Our Design Thinking and Innovation project helps HR professionals and candidates by simplifying hiring and improving the candidate experience through active support. The website will leverage an AI-powered Recruitment Bot to improve hiring efficiency. This platform automates resume screening, offers AI-driven candidate recommendations, streamlines interview scheduling and gathers real-time feedback. It delivers highly personalized candidate information through sentiment analysis and natural language processing, analysing several soft skills, aspects of cultural fit and many personality traits. The bot actively interacts with many candidates, thoroughly answering their queries, as well as consistently engaging them throughout the entire hiring process. HR benefits from a thorough analytics dashboard showing key recruitment trends, exact time-to-hire metrics and top candidate sources. Its integration of several ethics-driven hiring practices guarantees fairness, diversity and inclusion. This revolutionary solution optimizes a key part of recruiting, reduces bias and improves company decision-making, leading to smarter and more efficient hiring. A huge, powerful rocket.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
